# The Enduring Order: Society, Politics, and Urbanism in Ancient Egypt

This is an interactive single-page web application that brings research on Ancient Egyptian civilization to life. Instead of a linear document, this experience allows you to explore thematic areas such as:

- 🏜️ The Land  
- 👥 The People  
- ⚖️ The Power  
- 🏛️ The Legacy  
- 🏙️ The Cities  

The site features interactive diagrams, clickable social hierarchies, visual comparisons of city plans, and simplified concepts of Ma’at, all styled in a desert-inspired, immersive layout.
